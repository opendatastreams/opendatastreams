Open Data Streams
=================

The purpose of this website / community is to create a curated list of open data
streams.

# Motivation

When I started working with stream programming in the big data world, I was
surprised to discover that even if everybody talked about the upcoming big flow
of data coming from sensors/IoT and other real-time sources, really few
of these were available today. Most examples on real-time processing simply rely
on twitter as a source of data. This project exists to expand the awareness of
other open (free) data streams so people can combine them and create new
awesome things.

# Contribute

All contributions and submissions are welcome. please pay attention to respect
some basic rules, don't send:

- links to open data sources that are not streams (e.g. databases or CSV files).
- links to non-free data sources e.g. some financial exchanges.
- links to sources whose data is not explicitly free to use.

And now finally...
